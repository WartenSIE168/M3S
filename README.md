# Reference Code for AAAI-20 paper "Multi-Stage Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Convolutional Networks on Graphs with Few Labels"

Please refer to **Deeper Insights into Graph Convolutional Networks for Semi-Supervised Learning** (AAAI 2018) github: https://github.com/liqimai/gcn/tree/AAAI-18/, since our code is directly adapted from this paper.  

We are still sorting out our source code, but before that you can try your ideas based on this code and compare results with us shown in our paper directly.
